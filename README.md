This Machine learning model predicts the groundwater quality and the types of crops it is suitable for. It predicts whether the water is portable for drinking or not. It gives a quantitative measure of EWQI. This model is trained on a vast amount of dataset which classifies water quality based on chemical composition and quality standards
